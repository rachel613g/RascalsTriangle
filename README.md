## RascalsTriangle

A project assigned by [Professor Andrew Schwimmer](https://github.com/andrewoid ""). 

#### The Task
The task was to design a non-recursive function to find the mth number
in the nth row of Rascal's Triangle.

See [this]( https://github.com/rachel613g/RascalsTriangle/blob/master/RascalsTriangle.pdf "") for the original question 
asked in a contest.

See [this brief explanation](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/Anggoro2010.pdf "") of the difference between Pascal's
Triangle and Rascal's Triangle as well as the derivation of the formula to 
find the mth number in the nth row of the Rascal Triangle.
